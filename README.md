Employees are the valuable assets of any company. But if they quit jobs 
unexpectedly, it may incur huge cost to any company. Because new hiring will consume 
not only money and time but also the freshly hired employees take time to make the 
respective company profitable. In the past, most of the focus on the ‘rates’ such as attrition 
rate and retention rates. HR Managers compute the previous rates try to predict the future 
rates using data warehousing tools. Hence, in this study, I try to build a model employee 
churn prediction model which predicts either the employees will leave their current 
company or stay in the company based on Employee churn dataset obtained from Kaggle 
website. Within the study's scope, we have trained standard and sequential models using 
python then evaluated the model performance. In the experimental part, the histogram is 
generated, which shows the contrast between left employees vs. salary, department, 
satisfaction level, etc. Here, you can predict who, and when an employee will terminate the 
service. Employee churn is expensive, and incremental improvements will give significant 
results. It will help us in designing better retention plans and improving employee 
satisfaction.
